For this week I mainly continued working on the logistics of my project. I am coordinated with Steven in the Theatre department to get a list of props in prop storage that can be used in my capstone project. This will finally help me finalize my budget and start thinking of how the different items can be arranged in the room. I have also rented out a projector to help me prototype. I am able to project my ideas onto the wall to sort of invision how it would look like in a room. It helps me answer questions of 1. how much space should any particular piece take up? and 2. How well do they fit together?. 

There is not much tangible to update on since the week mainly consisted of me coordinating with my mentor and other parties over email to get a sense of what can and cannot be done or used before moving forward.
