This week I worked on brainstorming and planning the story line of my project. I also had a meeting with Michael Allison to help with getting tips on building an interactive story. I took notes and will help apply them throughout this week. I am also meeting Judi from the seam shop tomorrow to discuss the story I have come up with so far. 

I have a rough idea of the clues I want but still need to figure out a way to connect them. After talking to Michael I decided to follow this method:

1. Introduction clues; meeting the characters, getting a big picture idea
2. Intersection clues; how the characters or story parts interact with each other
3. Hidden reveal; final revelation of how everything fits together, and where the volunteer fits into the story as well

I am hoping after also talking to Judi I can get deeper into figuring out the story and clues, and I hope to start building the clues by early next week. I'll probably reach out to Jon about getting help building a chalkboard to host someone of the clues. I will also order my parts, i.e. locks and puzzle accessories so I can start putting things together.

I am also working on finalzing a calendar to share here and with my advisor that has some deadlines for myself as I begin executing the project. This will help me not only visualize when I need to finish but also figure out what needs to be cut out or added as I finish items. 

Finally, I changed the room I wanted to 036 since it fits the classroom theme of my escape room a lot better. I felt like in the larger black box I would be fighitng against the theatre aspect of the space which would take a lot more time and consideration than I have at the moment.
