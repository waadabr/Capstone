My current capstone idea is still in its early stages but I have been brainstorming and exploring different ways to combine my interests. I decided I wanted to do something in
in relation to both UX and education. I am interested in UX because I enjoy learning about the how users or viewers interpret a piece or interact with it verses how it was 
intended to be percieved. In terms of education, I have been in many conversations about what it means to learn, how public education should be improved or things that should
be considered for a student to be successful, and also just the general importance of an inclusive educational enviornment. 

I am not yet sure how the outcome of this project will look but I do know I want it to be interactive and thought provoking. I'd like the goal of my project to have users leaving
with thoughts and persoanl discussions on the educaitonal systems in their home countries or reflect on their educational background as well. There are sitll logisitcal 
questions I am working through, like what audience to focus on. Ideally, I think high school would be a good fit since, at least in my experience, is more structured and enforced
than college education where you choose your courses, major, etc. For now, I've attached my brainstorm questions for the prototype since I am still working on how this should be 
presented and where. 

For next steps, I am going to do research into effective teaching methods, specify which region's educational system I'd like to focus on while also exploring ways to make 
the project genral and applicable to other areas. I will also be looking into the best way to make this piece interactive whether physical, virtual, or a combination of both.
