For my second prototype I took inspiration from a class I am taking this semester called designing the future. Instead of just going over the syllabus, my professor presented us with the syllabus he used last year and used it as a template to create the new syllabus for this year with us. As a class we decided how we wanted to format our assignments, make the best use of class time and also what midterm and final we wanted to work on. At first I thought "everyone is just going to pick whatever is easieest to do" but students actually gave interesting propositions. One student suggested we do a thesis defense instead of a presenation to engage other classmates and also ensure they know about the presented topic not just learning from the presenter. Another student suggested we focus on socratic discussions becuase the course goal relied on students sharing they're thoughts on how the future will turn out given its current progression in technology or otherwise. I thought it was a very interesting experience and would like to incorporate it in my capstone.

My idea for at least a part of this project is possibly giving viewers or attendees the opportunity to be apart of creating a curriculum. I could present them with a goal for the class and then give them options for how they would want this course to be taught or the curriculum to be structured. I would ideally like to make it more collaborative so either making it a team based installation or adding bots that would act as other students, assuming this would be done in a computer program. I think the idea of involving the student in the learning design process is a unique way to give students voices and make them apart of their education and not just floating through or following a professors orders.

The next step would be to figure out the logistics for how this installation should work. Is it possible to create a digital collaboration platform? Should it be on paper and pencil? Is it team based or individual? I will also be discussing more with my professor on his thoughts for why he chose to structure our first class in that way. I will also continue to research educational systems and ways to engage students better.
