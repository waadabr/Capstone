For this week, I discussed my progress so far with my advisor and compared it to the calendar I made for staying on track. I am feeling a more stressed as we near the midterm season. It is only a matter of time before it is time to install and showcase our projects. 

Feedback from critique:
* The main critique I recieved was related to the beginning of the story/ escape room. The concern was that with my original plot of the auidence members helping the 4 students escape, it was confusing how you'd help people escape that you can't see. I hadn't thought about that point but it made sense in retrospect. One solution that was posed was to have inanimate models in the room. I wasn't the biggest fan of this because I fear it would draw too much focus away from the characters description and further wouldn't make sense to help them escape if they can't move on their own. Also, having an player carry them isn't ideal for this project.

After giving it some thought, I decided to change the story so that the 4 characters I've created have already escaped, but the players need to figure out how. So the new storyline is that the 4 players got detention on prom night. They hear a rumor that a few students escaped a while back and left clues for other students, but no one's been able to figure it out. If you want to make it to prom night in time, you'll need to figure out how they did it and beat the clock.

I think this new storyline is simple and resolves the concern. It also maintains the players in the role of student which is ideal because that is the headspace I'd like them to be in this discussion. 

I also worked on the overall puzzle layout, and I actually figured out how the whole plan comes together in simple. However, I was working on the overflow app and I'm not sure what happened but all my data was gone. Thankfully, I had sketched and written some of it down on paper but I will have to make up the work again. I am hoping it'll take less time this time around but I am slightly worried about the time set back. 

I am planning to complete the layout flow again by mid- week in order to share it around for feedback. I hope to read and analzye the feedback by mid next week, meanwhile getting started on heavier construction items and gathering materials for the puzzles.
