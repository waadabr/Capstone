Up to this point I've done research about both the educational background of the conversation I am trying to create for my capstone, as well as looking into how I'd like to tangibly present the topic through the use of digital media like VR. I have created a list of questions (seen below) that have helped me guide conversations with peers, friends, and professors alike to hear their thoughts and spark discussions that help shape my project. I have set up interviews with two professors at NYU now to discuss their work and thoughts on the goals of education, whether it needs to change, and general thoughts around the topic. 

An experience I had outside of class that I inspires my capstone now is a halloween haunted house event at the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philedelphia. As part of the event there was an immersive exhibit discussing the rate of incarceration, how it relates to the crime rate, and what factors are at play (business model, racial injustice, school to prison pipline, and negligable change in crime rate to name a few). The experinece used different forms of digital media and interaction (photographed below) to make a point about the issue at hand. Two of the most memorable pieces were the stories written by both visitors of the exhibit and those who were incarcerated. The interaction had users read the stories and guess which anonymous submissions came from people who actually went to prison, and which didn't. The point of this exercise was to show that although we, in the United States, are incarcerating a lot more people it's not changing the crime rate nor are all the criminals being brought to justice as is falsely claimed. Another part of the exhibit that I loved was a "write a letter to your future self" interactivity. Three questions were presented related to the individuals thoughts around incarceration and education and the letter would be emailed to you at different times in the future. I thought both of these interactions were a great way to immerse the user in the conversation at hand. Particulary, I thought the letter was a great take away item that would make users reflect on the issue even in the future and depending on how things have progressed  

#Questions:

  Main things I want to tackle:
  
  Issues: What are the issues with the educational system?
  
      Lack of consideration for learning styles
      How is success measured?
      Equity vs equality for students (how are they being treated?) â†’ tracking and labeling leading to self-fulfilling prophecies 
      How are they choosing what to teach students?
      Are things like creativity being nurtured or diminished for the sake of uniformity?
      
  Future consequences: what goal is being achieved by the current system and how does that affect the society we are creating?
  
      How school is a social institution that reinforces socioeconomic status, class disparity, and racial injustice
      What does exposure mean in school, how can we better prepare students for the real world? (technology, financial literacy, media literacy, etc. in this new digital age)
