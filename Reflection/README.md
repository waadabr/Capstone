Reflection: 

Up to this point I've done research about both the educational background of the conversation I am trying to create for my capstone, as well as looking into how I'd like to tangibly present the topic through the use of digital media like VR. I have created a list of questions (seen below) that have helped me guide conversations with peers, friends, and professors alike to hear their thoughts and spark discussions that help shape my project. I have set up interviews with two professors at NYU now to discuss their work and thoughts on the goals of education, whether it needs to change, and general thoughts around the topic. I am also talking to Michael Allison this week to get ideas on the feasibility of VR for my project and hopefully some better insight on how to get started with prototyping a few ideas. 

Questions:

  Main things I want to tackle:
  
  Issues: What are the issues with the educational system?
  
      Lack of consideration for learning styles
      How is success measured?
      Equity vs equality for students (how are they being treated?) → tracking and labeling leading to self-fulfilling prophecies 
      How are they choosing what to teach students?
      Are things like creativity being nurtured or diminished for the sake of uniformity?
      
  Future consequences: what goal is being achieved by the current system and how does that affect the society we are creating?
  
      How school is a social institution that reinforces socioeconomic status, class disparity, and racial injustice
      What does exposure mean in school, how can we better prepare students for the real world? (technology, financial literacy, media literacy, etc. in this new digital age)


An experience I had outside of class that I inspires my capstone now is a halloween haunted house event at the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philedelphia. As part of the event there was an immersive exhibit discussing the rate of incarceration, how it relates to the crime rate, and what factors are at play (business model, racial injustice, school to prison pipline, and negligable change in crime rate to name a few). The experinece used different forms of digital media and interaction (photographed below) to make a point about the issue at hand. Two of the most memorable pieces were the stories written by both visitors of the exhibit and those who were incarcerated. The interaction had users read the stories and guess which anonymous submissions came from people who actually went to prison, and which didn't. The point of this exercise was to show that although we, in the United States, are incarcerating a lot more people it's not changing the crime rate nor are all the criminals being brought to justice as is falsely claimed. Another part of the exhibit that I loved was a "write a letter to your future self" interactivity. Three questions were presented related to the individuals thoughts around incarceration and education and the letter would be emailed to you at different times in the future. I thought both of these interactions were a great way to immerse the user in the conversation at hand. Particulary, I thought the letter was a great take away item that would make users reflect on the issue even in the future and depending on how things have progressed could bring up the conversation again. I think this experience definetly gave me some ideas on how I want to engage the user even after the conversation in this exhibit is over.

Another project that inspired me is a play called The Nether. This play focuses on a case of sexual misconduct that was committed in the virtual world through the use of VR. It tackles questions of pedophilia in VR and whether it is an acceptable form of expression in a virtual world given that the technology is becoming more and more immersive. I thought the play did a great job of depicting the issue and drawing the audience into a very difficult corner of ethics and morals around the topic. It gave me ideas of how to present my project in VR and to perhaps use it as a audience experience rather than interactive considering the same feelings can be arised in this way too.

The topic of education is very large and multifaceted, which makes the conversation I want very difficult to manage but I am enjoying the process of figuring out what it means to facilitate an "organic" conversation through digital media. As I read more about VR, I am also excited to test the bounds of immersion in a conversational enviornment. I think however successful the project may be, it may give a lot of insight on the use of VR as a tool to encourage other important conversations that every day people should be apart of because it also affects their lives. I am still going through the process of piecing together this project but I am inspired but many other exhbits around me and excited to see where it leads
