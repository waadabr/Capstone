Here are my notes from my meetings with Steven from the theatre department and my capstone advisor Michael Shiloh:
2/3 
  Talk about meeting with steven
  Got to see a lot of the stuff they have
  Room 045 â†’ black box, great space that can be manipulated 
  Explore different ways to mimic a two rooms without an actual wall
  Different lights
  Lights turned off
  Situational vs physical access 
  Can hang stuff up on the wall 
  How much space do I want to take up?
Seeing the space helped me visualize it a little better 
Next steps:
Need to create a mood board/floor plan
Need to identify what I need 
Notes from Michael
Next to his office, where service elevator comes
Partition that look like black boards
Use ad dividers perhaps 
Maps, art supplies 
Populate the space with it
