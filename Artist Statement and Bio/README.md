## Artist Statement:

How successful would you say your education is or was? Was everything you learned useful? Do you remember it? How much did you have to learn on your own after high school? 
 
These are all questions that I have been pondering for the past year. Reflecting on my education was prompted by a conversation I had with a friend, and later one of my professors at NYU, about things I wish I knew before becoming an “adult”. Things like financial literacy, exposure to other fields or skills (we did not have computer science in my high school, let alone digital media), and cultural competency, to name a few. These topics are not only important to know as an adult, but being knowledgeable about them at an earlier age would reduce trial and error methods on the individual level, but create a more understanding and empathetic society when it comes to cultural acceptance and competency. Beyond that, it gives students a headstart on answering life long questions like “what is my passion?” and “what do I want to do with my life?”. 
 
This project aims to immerse the user in a reflective space where they can engage in discourse on their educational backgrounds. In no way is this intended to provide solutions to the issues that can be found with existing systems, nor is it claiming to show all existing education systems. Instead, audience members are invited to experience the installation bringing their own educational experiences to reflect on and share with others.
